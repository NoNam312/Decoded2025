## 🚀 About Decoded
Decoded is an annual **Semester 1** workshop designed for beginner programmers to dive into **React** by building modular and reusable **React Widgets**.

Throughout the workshop, students gain hands-on experience in designing and implementing interactive widgets. Those eager to push their skills further can participate in **Hackiethon**, a hackathon where they collaborate and build exciting projects using React.

📌 **All details are available on Notion:** [Decoded Notion Page](https://plum-soda-d5f.notion.site/Decoded-1bc996f226c88037a95dc1222f53a1a1)

## 🛠️ Getting Started with React

### Step 1: Install Node.js
React requires **Node.js**, which comes bundled with **npm (Node Package Manager)**.

📥 **Download & Install the latest LTS version from:** [Node.js Official Website](https://nodejs.org/en)

### Step 2: Verify Installation
Once installed, check if Node.js and npm are installed properly by running the following commands in your terminal:

```sh
node -v  # Displays Node.js version
npm -v   # Displays npm version
```

### Step 3: Create a React App
1. Create a new folder and open it in **Visual Studio Code**.
2. Open the **terminal** in VS Code and run the following command:

```sh
npx create-react-app my-app
```

3. Once the setup is complete, navigate into your project and start the development server:

```sh
cd my-app
npm start
```

This will launch the React app in your default browser.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting (Windows)
If **Node.js isn’t recognized in your terminal**, you may need to manually add it to your system's **PATH**:

1. Open **Environment Variables** (Search for "Environment Variables" in the Start Menu).
2. Under **System Variables**, find `Path` and click **Edit**.
3. Click **New** and add the path to Node.js (e.g., `C:\Program Files\nodejs\`).
4. Click **OK** and restart your terminal.
5. Verify the installation again by running:

```sh
node -v
npm -v
```
